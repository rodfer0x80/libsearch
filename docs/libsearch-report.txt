--:: Design and implementation of a library search system  ::--
----
-- Introduction
:: This project focus on the design and implementation of a system allowing users to search for books by title, adding new books and removing lost/damaged books.
----
-- Technical terms:
:: qty = quantity
:: ISBN = international serial book number
----
-- Design
:: Algorithm analysis for searching, adding and removing books.
:: Non-standard data structure  to represent the data from the book objects.
:: Store data WITH capitalisation
:: Search
:::: Algorithm input is a search query, return all book where the search query is the	 										same to book name
:::: Add :: after selection book function qty++
:::: Remove :: after selection book function qty--
:::: Read open file and query for the book, once found return all text until the new line
:: Data format
:::: title	author;(s)	ISBN	qty

-- Implementation:
:: We will only be using C/C++ std libraries for this project as this should prove enough to handle the tasks required.
:: File structure
If we have the books sorted
